# Diamond Price Prediction 💎

## About The Project🚀
Welcome to the Diamond Price Prediction project. This is machine learning end to end project aims to predict diamond prices using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to understand the relationship between various features of diamonds and their prices.

## Process📝
The process of predicting diamond prices involves several steps, including data ingestion, transformation (feature engineering), and model training. The features considered for this project are carat, cut, clarity, dimensions (x, y, z), depth, table, and color. This is a regression problem, and we have used various machine learning models to solve it.

### Data Ingestion and Transformation🔄
The first step in our process was to ingest the dataset. After ingestion, we performed feature engineering to transform the data and make it suitable for model training.

### Model Training✍️
We trained various models on the dataset, including Logistic Regression (Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet), Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor.

### Model Evaluation💯
After training, we evaluated the models. The K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor model yielded the highest R2 score, making it the best model for this dataset.

### Application Development and Deployment☁️
We developed an application using the Flask framework to make our model accessible. The application was then deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk using CodePipeline from GitHub, allowing users to interact with our model in a user-friendly way.
